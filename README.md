### **Running the Application**

1.  **Start the development server:**

    ```
    This command launches a local server and watches for file changes, automatically reloading the page as you code. The application will typically be available at `http://localhost:5173`.

### **Additional Commands**

* **Build for Production:**
    ```bash
    cd Site
    npm run build
    ```
    This command creates an optimized, production-ready build of your app and places the files in the `dist` folder.

* **Preview Production Build (locally):**

    npm run preview
    ```
    Use this to test the production build on a local server before deploying it.
